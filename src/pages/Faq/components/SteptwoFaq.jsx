          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              Soft breach means that we will close all trades that have violated
              the rule. However, you can continue trading in your Assessment or
              Funded Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hard breach means that you violated either the Daily Loss Limit or
              Max Drawdown rule. Both rules constitute a hard breach. In the
              event you have a hard breach, you will fail the Assessment or have
              your Funded Account taken away.

            <span className="font-bold text-orange-500">Example:</span> if your
            prior day’s end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account
            would violate the daily stop loss limit if your equity reached
            $95,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$5,000 on a
            $100,000 account, your new- day (5pm EST) max loss is based on your
            balance from the previous day ($100,000). So, your daily loss limit
            would still be $95,000.

      question: "How do you calculate the Daily Loss Limit?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-white text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            The Daily Drawdown calculation will be based on the greater of the end of day BALANCE (closed P&L only) OR end of day EQUITY (balance + open P&L).
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, if a trader has profitable trades open at the end of the day, the trader’s equity will be higher than the balance. In this case, the equity will be used for the daily drawdown metric.
          </p>
            <p>
           As another example, if a $100k account, with 5% daily drawdown, finishes the day with open trades and has a balance of $100k and equity of $102k, since the equity is higher, the breach level will be based on the $102k equity value, resulting in a breach level of $96.9k
          </p>
            <p>
            If a trader has no open trades , balance and equity are the same → balance will be used for the daily drawdown metric (no change to the current calculation).

        <div className="space-y-4 text-white text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Maximum drawdown is the maximum your account can drawdown before you
            would hard breach your account. When you open the account, your
            Maximum Drawdown is set at 8% of your starting balance. This 8% is
            static and does not trail.

          <p>
            Yes. We will consider you inactive and your account will be breached
            if you do not have any trading activity on your account for 30
            consecutive days.{" "}

        <div className="space-y-4 text-white text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            We require all trades to be closed by 3:45 PM EST on the last
            trading day of the week, typically Friday. However, in cases where
            markets close early or are not open on a Friday, it is the trader’s
            responsibility to ensure all trades are closed before the weekend
            based on the adjusted market schedule. Any trades left open after
            this time will be automatically closed. Note, this is considered a
            soft breach, and you will be able to continue trading once the
            markets reopen.{" "}

          <p>
            The maximum position that you may open is determined by your
            available margin. We reserve the right to increase the margin
            requirement, limit the number of open positions you may enter or
            maintain in the Funded Account at any time, and to revise in
            response to market conditions the drawdown levels at which trading
            in the funded account will be halted. We or the Liquidity Provider
            reserve the right to refuse to accept any order.

        "Once I pass the Assessment am I provided with a demo or funded account?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-white text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Once you pass the Assessment, we provide you with a funded account,
            backed by our capital. The capital in your funded Account is
            notional and may not match the amount of capital on deposit with the
            Liquidity Provider. A Funded Account is notionally funded when
            actual funds in the account (i.e., the equity in a Funded Account
            represented by the amount of capital) differs from the nominal
            account size (i.e., the size of the Funded Account that establishes
            the initial account value and level of trading). Notional funds are
            the difference between nominal account size and actual capital in a
            funded account. Use of notional funding does not impact your trading
            conditions in any way.{" "}

        <div className="space-y-4 text-white text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            The rules for the funded account are exactly the same as your
            Assessment account. However, with a funded account, there is no
            profit target.

      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-white text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            If you have gains in your funded account at the time of a hard
            breach, you will still receive your portion of those gains.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold text-orange-500">For example:</span> if
            you have a $100,000 account and you grow that account to $110,000.

            the $10,000 in gains in your funded account, you would be paid your
            portion thereof.

      question:
        "When can I withdraw the gains in my funded account and how does that affect my Maximum Drawdown?",
      answer:
        "Your first withdrawal can be requested at any time, subject to an 80/20 profit split. Thereafter, you can request a withdrawal of the gains in your account every 30 days. When a withdrawal is approved, we will also withdraw our share of the gains. The drawdown does not reset when you request a withdrawal. Example: You have taken an account from $100,000 to $120,000. You then request a withdrawal of $16,000. In this scenario, you will receive $12,800 and we would retain $3,200. This would also take the balance of the account down to $104,000, and your Maximum Drawdown will remain$94,000. So, you would have $10,000 maximum you could lose on the account before it would violate the Maximum Drawdown rule. If you take a full withdrawal of the gains in your Funded Account, the Maximum Drawdown will still remain at $94,000.</p> ",

    {
      question: "How do I withdraw the gains in my funded account?",
      answer:
        "Traders can request a withdrawal of the gains in their funded account at any time in their trader dashboard, but no more frequently than once per thirty (30) days. So, if you make gain in your funded account, you can request a withdrawal. When you are ready to withdraw the gains from your funded account, click the Withdraw Profits button in your trader dashboard and enter the amount to withdraw. All such gains are distributed via the available outbound payment solutions offered from time to time. Once your withdrawal request is approved, we will pay the monies owed to you. We reserve the right to change the withdrawal methods and options at any time.",

    {
      question: "How Long does it take to receive my funded account?",
      answer:
        "Upon passing your Assessment, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access and complete both your “Know Your Customer” verification and your “Trader Agreement”. Once both are completed and supporting documentation is provided, your Funded Account will be created, funded and issued to you typically within 24-48 business hours. You will receive a confirmation email once this account is being enabled.",
